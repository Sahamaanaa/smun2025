                    Runs on coffee, caffeine, and broken sleep cycles. Late nights are spent awake for no reason other than to make everyone around him miserable. Weak arguments? Crushed. Drafts? Torn to shreds.

                    Anime keeps him twitchy and jittery. Research gives him ideas that are extreme, reckless, and probably illegal. Political opinions? Absolute chaos. No one sane can follow them, and that’s exactly the point.

                    Mistakes stick to him like flies. Sanity avoids him. Patience doesn’t exist in his vocabulary. He doesn’t lead, just guides things from the sidelines.

                    He’s the Deputy Secretary-General of SMUN—a caffeinated, chaotic, probably destructive force.</p></div>

Equal parts creativity and intellect, with a dash of mischief and a flair for storytelling, Ahmed doesn’t just go through life; he interrogates it, experiments with it, and leaves a trail of ideas, laughs, and memorable moments wherever he goes.

His fascination with Soviet and Russian aviation fuels an obsession with fighter jets, while cricket and Formula 1 keep his competitive fire alive. Rooted in his Rajput heritage, he’s naturally drawn to war-based committees where conflict, power, and strategy dominate. Relentless, fearless, and unapologetically radical in thought, he now serves SMUN 2025 as Vice Chairperson of the UNGA DISEC — Samrat Pratap Singh.</p></div><div class="tag">UNGA-DISEC</div></div>
